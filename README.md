# Statistical-Learning
A repository for homework assignments of the course Statistical Learning taught by Dr. Pourahmadi, in 2020


[logistic_regression_from_scratch.ipynb](https://github.com/saeedzou/Statistical-Learning/blob/main/logistic_regression_from_scratch.ipynb) implements logistic regression from scratch with the help of tensorflow automatic differentiation. The task is a binary classification for the notMNIST dataset which is trained with a binary crossentropy loss and a SGD optimizer with a weight decay of 0.01. The necessary plots are documented in the jupyter notebook.

[Assignment 1](https://github.com/saeedzou/Statistical-Learning/tree/main/Assignment%201) is an introductory assignment to understand the tradeoff between bias and variance, and also methods on model selection.

The pdf of the assignment is found [here](https://github.com/saeedzou/Statistical-Learning/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment1.pdf)

The first questions in the assignment are theoretical. [The third and fourth question](https://github.com/saeedzou/Statistical-Learning/blob/main/Assignment%201/q3_hw1.ipynb) regards the bias-variance tradeoff in choosing K in the KNN classification algorithm on the make_moons dataset. [The fifth question](https://github.com/saeedzou/Statistical-Learning/blob/main/Assignment%201/q5_hw1.ipynb) is a model selection between different polynomial degrees of regression on a hand-made dataset.
